HarmonyOS is a future-proof distributed operating system open to you as part of the initiatives for the all-scenario strategy, adaptable to mobile office, fitness and health, social communication, and media entertainment, to name a few. Unlike a legacy operating system that runs on a standalone device, HarmonyOS is built on a distributed architecture designed based on a set of system capabilities.
It is able to run on a wide range of device forms.
## Kernel Layer
Kernel subsystem: HarmonyOS uses a multi-kernel design so that appropriate OS kernels can be selected for devices with different resource limitations. The kernel abstraction layer (KAL) shields differences in kernel implementations and provides the upper layer with basic kernel capabilities, including process and thread management, memory management, file system, network management, and peripheral management.
